# AI-Powered Avatar Selection System

## Overview
Instead of random avatar assignment, the system now uses **AI to intelligently match users to avatars** based on their resume content and the avatar descriptions.

## How It Works

### 1. Avatar Descriptions Database
**File**: `geeme-description.json`

Contains descriptions for all 100 avatars:
```json
{
  "001": "man-with-glasses-and-a-laptop-bag",
  "002": "woman-with-brown-hair-and-a-football",
  ...
}
```

### 2. AI Selection Process

**Function**: `selectAvatarForUser()` in `/src/lib/ai.ts`

#### Step-by-Step:
1. **Extract Profile Summary** from parsed resume:
   ```typescript
   {
     name: "John Doe",
     title: "Software Engineer",
     about: "Experienced developer...",
     skills: ["JavaScript", "React", "Node.js", ...],
     topExperience: { company: "Tech Corp", position: "Senior Dev", ... },
     interests: ["E-commerce Platform", "Mobile App", ...]
   }
   ```

2. **AI Analysis** (using Cerebras Llama 3.1-8B):
   - Analyzes user's professional profile
   - Considers gender indicators (name, pronouns)
   - Matches professional context (tech ‚Üí laptop/computer accessories)
   - Looks at activities (sports, music, tech gadgets)
   - Evaluates professional vibe (formal ‚Üí suits, creative ‚Üí casual)

3. **Avatar Selection**:
   - AI receives full list of 100 avatar descriptions
   - Returns best match with reasoning
   - Falls back to random if AI fails

4. **Example AI Response**:
   ```json
   {
     "avatarNumber": "028",
     "reason": "Man with a camera matches creative tech professional with photography projects"
   }
   ```

### 3. Integration Points

#### A. Resume Upload (Anonymous & Authenticated)
**File**: `/src/app/api/upload/route.ts`

```typescript
// Parse resume
const portfolioConfig = await parseResumeToPortfolio(resumeText)

// AI selects matching avatar
const selectedAvatar = await selectAvatarForUser(portfolioConfig)
// Returns: "/avatars/028.svg"

// Save to database
await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    // ... other fields
    avatar: selectedAvatar
  }
})
```

**Flow**:
1. User uploads resume (PDF/DOCX)
2. Resume text extracted
3. AI parses resume ‚Üí PortfolioConfig
4. **AI selects best matching avatar** ‚Üê NEW!
5. User created with intelligent avatar
6. Portfolio displayed with matched avatar

#### B. Manual Signup (Email/Password)
**File**: `/src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`

Still uses `getRandomAvatar()` as a fallback since there's no resume content yet. When user later uploads resume, avatar gets updated.

#### C. OAuth Signup (Google/GitHub)
Gets random avatar initially. When user uploads resume, avatar is intelligently selected and updated.

### 4. Avatar Update Logic

**Smart Update** in upload route:
```typescript
// Only update avatar if user doesn't have one yet
if (!user.avatar) {
  await prisma.user.update({
    where: { id: user.id },
    data: { avatar: selectedAvatar }
  })
}
```

This means:
- ‚úÖ First resume upload ‚Üí Sets intelligent avatar
- ‚úÖ Subsequent uploads ‚Üí Keeps existing avatar (no random changes)
- ‚úÖ User can still manually upload custom image via Cloudinary

### 5. Display Priority

When showing user image:
```
1. Custom Upload (user.image) - Cloudinary uploaded photo
   ‚Üì (if null)
2. AI-Selected Avatar (user.avatar) - Intelligent match
   ‚Üì (if null)  
3. Default User Icon - Generic fallback
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Personalized User Experience**
- Avatar reflects user's profession and personality
- Creates immediate connection between user and profile
- More memorable than random assignment

### 2. **Professional Context**
- Tech professionals get tech-themed avatars
- Creative professionals get artistic/camera avatars
- Athletes get sports-themed avatars
- Formal roles get professional attire avatars

### 3. **Gender Awareness**
- AI considers name and profile context
- Matches to appropriate gender representation
- Respects professional identity

### 4. **Intelligent Fallback**
- If AI fails ‚Üí random avatar (graceful degradation)
- If no resume ‚Üí random avatar (signup without upload)
- Always ensures user has an avatar

### 5. **Consistency**
- Avatar set on first upload, then persists
- User can override with custom image anytime
- No confusing avatar changes on subsequent uploads

## Configuration

### AI Model Settings
```typescript
model: 'llama3.1-8b'
temperature: 0.3  // Low for consistent matching
max_tokens: 300
```

### Matching Criteria
The AI considers:
- **Gender Indicators**: Name patterns, pronouns
- **Professional Role**: Job titles, experience
- **Technical Context**: Skills, tools, technologies  
- **Activities**: Projects, hobbies, interests
- **Formality Level**: Corporate vs casual vs creative
- **Accessories**: Relevant props (laptop, camera, sports equipment)

## Performance

### Speed
- Avatar selection happens during resume parsing
- Adds ~1-2 seconds to upload process
- Parallel with portfolio config generation
- Non-blocking for user experience

### Accuracy
- AI provides reasoning for selection
- Logged for debugging and improvement
- Manual override available (user can upload custom image)

### Reliability
- Fallback to random on AI failure
- Always returns valid avatar path
- Error handling at every step

## Future Enhancements

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: All users getting same avatar
**Solution**: 
- Check AI API key is set in `.env`
- Verify Cerebras API is responding
- Check logs for avatar selection reasoning

### Issue: Avatar descriptions not loading
**Solution**:
- Ensure `geeme-description.json` is in project root
- Check import path in `ai.ts`
- Verify JSON file is valid

### Issue: TypeScript errors about `avatar` field
**Solution**:
```bash
bunx prisma generate
# Restart dev server
bun dev
# Restart VS Code TypeScript server (Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí Restart TS Server)
```

### Issue: AI selection taking too long
**Solution**:
- Check Cerebras API latency
- Consider caching avatar descriptions
- Add timeout fallback to random selection

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **Tech Professional Resume**
   - Upload resume with software engineering experience
   - Verify avatar has tech context (laptop, glasses, tech attire)

2. **Creative Professional Resume**
   - Upload resume with design/photography background
   - Verify avatar has creative elements (camera, artistic style)

3. **Female Professional Resume**
   - Upload resume with female name

# 4. Test fallback by temporarily disabling AI
# 5. Verify avatar persists across sessions
```
