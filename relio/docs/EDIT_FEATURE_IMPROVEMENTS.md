## Technical Details

### Code Changes
```typescript
// New timing
const timer0 = setTimeout(() => {...}, 6000);   // Was 3000
const timer1 = setTimeout(() => {...}, 11000);  // Was 5500
const timer2 = setTimeout(() => {...}, 16000);  // Was 8000
const timer3 = setTimeout(() => {...}, 21000);  // Was 10500
```

### New Stage 3 Structure
```tsx
<div className="space-y-4">
  <BlurText text="Live in just" ... />
  <ShinyText text={`${processingTime} seconds`} ... />
  <BlurText text="with Cerebras" ... />
</div>
```

## User Experience Impact
