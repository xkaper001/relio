# URL Normalization Fix

## Problem
When users enter URLs like `xkaper.dev` without the protocol (http:// or https://), browsers treat them as relative URLs, causing incorrect redirects like `relio.com/xkaper.dev` instead of navigating to the actual website.

## Solution
Added a `ensureHttps()` helper function that automatically adds `https://` prefix to URLs that don't already have a protocol.

### Implementation

```typescript
// Helper function to ensure URLs have proper protocol
const ensureHttps = (url: string): string => {
  if (!url) return url
  const trimmedUrl = url.trim()
  if (trimmedUrl.startsWith('http://') || trimmedUrl.startsWith('https://')) {
    return trimmedUrl
  }
  return `https://${trimmedUrl}`
}
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/components/PortfolioView.tsx`
- Added `ensureHttps()` helper function
- Applied to all social links (LinkedIn, GitHub, Website)
- Applied to all project links (Project Link, GitHub)

### 2. `/src/components/PortfolioViewAnimated.tsx`
- Added `ensureHttps()` helper function
- Applied to navigation social links
- Applied to hero section website link
- Applied to project links
- Applied to footer social links

### 3. `/src/app/dashboard/edit/page.tsx`
- Added `ensureHttps()` helper function
- Normalizes all URLs before saving to database in `handleSave()`
- Updated input placeholders to show correct format with `https://`

## URL Fields Covered
- ✅ LinkedIn profile URL
- ✅ GitHub profile URL
- ✅ Personal website URL
- ✅ Project demo links
- ✅ Project GitHub repository links

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- User enters: `xkaper.dev`
- Link redirects to: `relio.com/xkaper.dev` (broken)

### After
- User enters: `xkaper.dev` (with or without https://)
- Automatically normalized to: `https://xkaper.dev`
- Link correctly navigates to: `https://xkaper.dev`

## Edge Cases Handled
1. Empty/null URLs - Returns as-is
2. URLs with whitespace - Trimmed before processing
3. URLs already with http:// - Preserved
4. URLs already with https:// - Preserved
5. URLs without protocol - Adds https://

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Edit portfolio at `/dashboard/edit?slug=your-slug`
2. Enter URLs in different formats:
   - `xkaper.dev` → Saved as `https://xkaper.dev`
   - `http://example.com` → Saved as `http://example.com`
   - `https://github.com/user` → Saved as `https://github.com/user`
   - ` linkedin.com/in/profile ` → Saved as `https://linkedin.com/in/profile`
3. Save portfolio
4. Visit portfolio page
5. Click on social/project links - All should navigate correctly

### Validation
- Links open in new tab (`target="_blank"`)
- Security headers included (`rel="noopener noreferrer"`)
- Email links still use `mailto:` protocol (not affected)
- Phone links still use `tel:` protocol (not affected)

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add visual feedback showing normalized URL in input field
- [ ] Add URL validation to show errors for invalid formats
- [ ] Add copy-to-clipboard for portfolio links
- [ ] Support for custom protocols (e.g., `linkedin://`, `github://`)
