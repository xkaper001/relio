# Avatar Per Portfolio - Migration Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

### What Changed
**Avatar field moved from User model to Portfolio model**

---

## 🎯 Key Change

### Before:
- Each **user** had one avatar
- All portfolios showed the same avatar

### After:
- Each **portfolio** has its own avatar
- Different portfolios can have different avatars
- AI selects avatar per portfolio based on resume content

---

## 📊 Example

**User: Sarah Martinez**

**Old System:**
- One avatar for Sarah: `/avatars/015.svg`
- All her portfolios showed avatar #015

**New System:**
- Developer Portfolio → `/avatars/008.svg` (professional developer avatar)
- Designer Portfolio → `/avatars/023.svg` (creative designer avatar)  
- Manager Portfolio → `/avatars/042.svg` (leadership avatar)

Each portfolio gets an avatar that matches its content!

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Database (schema.prisma):
```prisma
model User {
  // avatar field REMOVED ❌
  portfolios Portfolio[]
}

model Portfolio {
  avatar String? // avatar field ADDED ✅
}
```

### Upload Route:
```typescript
// Avatar assigned to portfolio during creation
portfolios: {
  create: {
    slug: uniqueSlug,
    avatar: selectedAvatar, // ✅ Per portfolio
    config: portfolioConfig,
  },
}
```

### Display:
```typescript
// Portfolio page gets avatar from portfolio
avatar: portfolio.avatar  // ✅ Not user.avatar
```

## 🎨 AI Avatar Selection

Each time a resume is uploaded:

2. Matches to best-fitting avatar from 100 options
3. Assigns that avatar to the NEW portfolio
4. Different resumes → different avatars

---

## ✅ Benefits

1. **Personalized**: Each portfolio matches its content

3. **Flexible**: Unlimited portfolios with unique avatars
4. **Smart**: AI picks the right avatar per portfolio
