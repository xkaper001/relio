# Portfolio Edit Feature

## Overview
Added a comprehensive edit functionality that allows users to modify their portfolio data directly through a user-friendly interface.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Edit Page (`/src/app/dashboard/edit/page.tsx`)
Created a full-featured edit page with the following capabilities:

#### Features:
- **Basic Information Editing**: Name, title, and about section
- **Contact Information**: Email, phone, location, LinkedIn, GitHub, and website
- **Skills Management**: Comma-separated skills input
- **Experience Management**: 
  - Add/remove multiple work experiences
  - Edit position, company, dates, description, and achievements
- **Education Management**:
  - Add/remove multiple education entries
  - Edit institution, degree, field, GPA, and dates
- **Projects Management**:
  - Add/remove multiple projects
  - Edit name, description, technologies, project link, and GitHub link

#### User Experience:
- Sticky header with save button for easy access
- Real-time form updates
- Success/error notifications
- Automatic redirect to dashboard after successful save
- Delete buttons for removing individual entries
- Add buttons for adding new entries in each section

### 2. Updated Dashboard (`/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Added an "Edit" button next to the "View Live" button
- Button navigates to `/dashboard/edit` route
- Uses the existing `Edit` icon from lucide-react

## API Integration

The edit feature uses the existing API endpoint:
- **PUT `/api/portfolio`**: Updates portfolio configuration in the database

The endpoint already supports updating the portfolio data through the `config` field stored as JSON in the database.

## How to Use

1. **Navigate to Dashboard**: Go to `/dashboard` after logging in
2. **Click Edit Button**: Click the "Edit" button in the portfolio section
3. **Make Changes**: Modify any field in the comprehensive form
4. **Add/Remove Sections**: Use the "+" buttons to add new entries or trash icons to remove existing ones
5. **Save Changes**: Click "Save Changes" at the top or bottom of the page
6. **View Updated Portfolio**: After saving, you'll be redirected to the dashboard and can view the live portfolio

## Technical Details

### Data Structure
The portfolio data is stored as a JSON object with the following structure:
```typescript
interface PortfolioConfig {
  name: string
  title: string
  about: string
  email?: string
  phone?: string
  location?: string
  linkedin?: string
  github?: string
  website?: string
  skills: string[]
  experience: Experience[]
  education: Education[]
  projects: Project[]
}
```

### State Management
- Uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for local state management
- Fetches portfolio data on component mount
- Updates local state for real-time editing
- Sends all changes to the API when saving

### Form Validation
- Basic validation through input types
- Required fields are enforced through the data structure
- Empty arrays are allowed for optional sections

### Database Update
- Uses Prisma's `upsert` operation in the existing API
- Updates the `config` JSON field in the Portfolio model
- Automatically updates the `updatedAt` timestamp

## Benefits

1. **User Control**: Users can now directly edit their portfolio without re-uploading their resume
2. **Flexibility**: Add, edit, or remove any section of the portfolio
3. **Real-time Updates**: Changes are reflected immediately after saving
4. **Persistent Storage**: All changes are saved to the PostgreSQL database
5. **User-Friendly**: Intuitive interface with clear labels and helpful placeholders

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Auto-save functionality
- Form validation with error messages
- Rich text editor for descriptions
- Image upload for profile picture
- Drag-and-drop reordering of sections
- Preview mode before saving
- Version history/undo functionality
